on hot days he would get out of the sun and go into his barn and look for parts
to fix the machines that were broken and busted
he never threw machines away
he always repaired or rebuilt them.

they were stubborn things but they survived harsh seasons
mud would get on them and they were prone to rust
when they'd break down and could run no more
he would show them how to work again. 

the tract was large and each one was much needed
to do certain things in order to finish their great work
horizons receded from long days to forever
and each machine was given new sight.

the tasks turned to joy and the aches went away
lost parts and regrets faded with the routine
love became the bond between him and the machines
and the work was never complete but that was okay.
